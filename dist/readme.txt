Welcome to Culturehack!
The aim of the game is simple: find the Mind on the 20th level.
It will be far from easy though, and if your character is killed you will have to start again.
To descend a level, find the stairs on each map. Along the way you will have to fight many enemies.

CHARACTER CREATION:
Selecting 'new game' in the main menu will take you to character generation. You must first choose your character type from one of three classes.

1. Culture Human
	An all round character with average - high scores across all attribute levels. No particular specialty, but starts with a trench coat and
	a laser pistol

2. Mercenary
	A character focussed on strength and ranged weapon skill. Has much higher starting strength and average to high dexterity and accuracy.
	Other attribute scores tend to be lower. The Mercenary starts the game with a Rifle.

3. Rogue
	This character's focus is speed and melee skill. The Rogue has high dexterity and agility, making her nimble and quick in hand-to-hand
	combat. The Rogue begins with a nano-blade.

Once you have selected your character type, you will have to enter their name. Simply type your desired name and hit enter to begin your
journey.

PLAYING THE GAME:
You must reach level 20 and find the Mind in order to complete the game. Explore each level using the movement keys, and try to kill any enemies that you find.
Rooms in the level will only become visible once you have explored them, and its best to try to explore the whole map so you don't miss out on any
items. If your health (HP) starts to get low, it can be safer to run away from enemies rather than stay and fight. It is useful to pay attention to the information
panel at the bottom of the screen, as this will make you aware of details you might have otherwise missed. Remember that the game is turn-based, so there is no
benefit to playing quickly. It is usually better to take your time and think things through before you act!  

SAVING THE GAME:
The game will save automatically when you press escape or when your character dies. You cannot save the game manually.
